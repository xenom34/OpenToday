# Bug fix: Just fix it
# Adding a new feature:
* If you are sure, add (be careful, I may not like it and I will not accept it!)
* It is better to consult me, maybe I will give advice or reject this idea

# Issues marked with the 'allow-to-fix' label can be corrected without my request
If you decide to fix issues, write in the comments to it
```markdown
# I'm fixing it
* [ ] I have already created a fork and am trying to fix it; the fork is available at the link: <link here>
```
